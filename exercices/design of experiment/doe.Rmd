# Describing the experiment
I generated a dataset of 25 entries by modifying the 11 xi values and getting the output value corresponding to them. 
The goal is to get the function F like F(X)=Y, X is a vector of 11 elements.
We store it in a csv file
```{r}
library(dplyr)
df =read.csv(file="user_e7268.csv", colClasses=c("NULL", NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA))
df
```

First, we figure out that the intercept F(0) is 1.0152508.


We can use a linear regression for a sanity check and we see that we obtain exactly the same result. This linear regression will also allow us to predict.

```{r}
form <- as.formula(paste("y~", paste0("x", 1:11, collapse="+")))
reg=lm(form,data=df)
reg
```

```{r}
plot(df)
```
